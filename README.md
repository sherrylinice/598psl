# 598psl

Please read the following instructions before running the app locally and online. Thank you! 

--------------------------For running the app locally---------------------------
1. Download the zipped folder "Source_code_Project_4_2282_xuehail2" from Coursera, and unzip it.

2. Alternatively, you can clone this repository from Github: https://github.com/sherrylinice/598psl.git. Remember to download all the data files under the path of `Proj4`, including `app.py`, `movie_id_to_index.pkl`, `movie_ids.pkl`, `popular_movies.csv`, `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt`. And remove the `Proj4/` from all the paths for the data and model files. 

3. Ensure all the requirements are installed and the runtime python version is compatible. 

4. Inside the `Proj4` folder where the `app.py` and all the model and data files are located, in command line (terminal for Mac), run this: `streamlit run app.py`. The web app will be automatically opened in a new web browser from `localhost:8501`.

--------------------------For running the app online---------------------------

4. For Project 4, the Movie Recommender App is deployed on Streamlit Cloud: 
<https://598psl-fb9ejnukctw65spysrhxeb.streamlit.app/>

5. Due to the setting of Streamlit Community cloud and its free nature, the app will go into sleep mode due to long time inactivity. It will display a button on the link above to reactivate the app. Click that button, within a few minutes or less, the app will run online.
